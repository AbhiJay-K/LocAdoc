Location based file encryption software

## About LocAdoc project
This project aim to provide user a way to store confidential documents in mobile devices and access it only in the area he/she find it is safe. By including two factor protections, one being password (what the user knows) and second being the location (where the user is currently), we will be able to provide a better solution compared to the applications currently in the market (based on market survey).
These are few ways a document in a mobile device may be compromised: -  
-	The documents stored in mobile device may end up in the wrong hands if the device itself is stolen. 
-	The user may lend the device to someone who intern may wish to gain access to these documents.
-	The documents may be accessed remotely by penetrating device through network. 
  
  
Our solution aim to provide a secure vault for document storage so the it does not get into wrong hands even if the device is compromised. The solution also provide a secure backup cloud storage with double layer encryption one by the app itself and one by Amazon server.
